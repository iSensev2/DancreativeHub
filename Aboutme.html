        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Dan Louigie Dizon, a 23-year-old graduate as of August 10, 2023 at International Eletronic and Technical Institute-Alabang, with a passion for web development. In the past six months, I've delved into the world of coding, focusing initially on honing my front-end skills before venturing into the intricacies of back-end development. A dreamer at heart, my ultimate goal is to evolve into a versatile full-stack developer, and beyond that, aspire to become a Software Engineer.
            Beyond the world of coding, my interests are as diverse as my skill set. </p>
        <p>I find solace in the beats of K-pop, particularly as a fervent fan of ITZY and fromis_9. When not immersed in lines of code, I'm navigating through the virtual landscapes of MOBA and FPS games. The allure of capturing moments through photography has become a cherished hobby, complementing my love for both online and physical books.
            This journey is not merely about acquiring skills but a pursuit of dreams and ambitions. With each line of code written, I'm stepping closer to realizing my goals. Through dedication and unwavering passion, I'm scripting a narrative where I, Dan Louigie Dizon, not only master the realms of web development but also emerge as a Software Engineer, creating a legacy through lines of code and captured memories alike.</p>
